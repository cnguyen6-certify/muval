Meaningful Use Validator based on NIST's own.

== Introduction

NIST's Meaningful Use Validator is great to check if your CCDs are valid.
However it runs as as a Command Line Utility that outputs XML.
If you want to make validation part of your unit tests, you need it to be callable from code.
This project aims to do just that.
NIST made its code available http://cda-validation.nist.gov/cda-validation/downloads.html[here].
Also they consider their code to be public domain.
That makes it possible for this project to exist.
I am thankful for that.
